<h2>Toplogical Sort - Pseudo Code</h2>
1. For all nodes, set their backedges to NULL, <strong>distances</strong> to -1, number of distinctive path to 0, and compute the number of incoming edges. <br>
2. For nodes whose incoming edge is 0, set their number of distinctive path to 1 and append them to a list. <br>
3. Set the staring node's distance to 0. <br>
4. Repeat the following: <br>
<div style="margin-left: 50px">
1. Remove the first node n from the list. Let d be n's distance.
2. For each adjescent edge. Let n2 be the destination node. Do the following: <br>
  <div style="margin-left: 50px">
    1. Decrement n2's number of incoming edges by one. If n2's incoming edges is reduced to 0. We append n2 to the list. <br>
    2. Add n's number of distinctive path to n2's number of distinctive path <br>
    3. If n2's distance is -1 or d + edge's weight < n2's distance, update n2's distance.
